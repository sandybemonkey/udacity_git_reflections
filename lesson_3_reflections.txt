WHEN WOULD YOU WANT TO USE A REMOTE REPOSITORY RATHER THAN KEEPING ALL YOUR WORK LOCAL?

When you want to share your work or you have to collaborate with other on the repository


WHY MIGHT YOU WANT TO ALWAYS PULL CHANGES MANUALLY RATHER THAN HAVING GIT AUTOMATICALLY STAY UP-TO-DATE WITH YOUR REMOTE REPOSITORY?

because you want to alway have a remote master branch alway bug free so you may be no want to push bug on you remote repository an avoid that.

WHEN WOULD YOU WANT TO USE A REMOTE REPOSITORY RATHER THAN KEEPING ALL YOUR WORK LOCAL?

When you want to share your work or you have to collaborate with other on the repository


WHY MIGHT YOU WANT TO ALWAYS PULL CHANGES MANUALLY RATHER THAN HAVING GIT AUTOMATICALLY STAY UP-TO-DATE WITH YOUR REMOTE REPOSITORY?

to stay in control of what you pull.


DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FORKS, CLONES, AND BRANCHES. WHEN WOULD YOU USE ONE INSTEAD OF ANOTHER?

A fork is a clone on github server of a github project. use this when you want to have a copy of the project on your github account.

A clone is a copy of a repository that that you generally put in your computer.You use it when you want to get a copy of a github repository on you local machine

a branch is as the name suggest another version o the repository but in the same repository.You use that when you want to experiment or try a new feat befor merging it with the Master Branch


WHAT IS THE BENEFIT OF HAVING A COPY OF THE LAST KNOWN STATE OF THE REMOTE STORED LOCALLY?

The benefits is to alway be able to have a point to compare and you can avoid conflicts later on


HOW WOULD YOU COLLABORATE WITHOUT USING GIT OR GITHUB? WHAT WOULD BE EASIER, AND WHAT WOULD BE HARDER?

without git or git hub I would have to:

Make a copy everytime i change something
to collaborate i would hav to send a new copy to my collaborator each time i make a change taht can stay up to date on my work and same go for them
And at the and every collaborator should have his lastest version and see what and where change were made to get the prodution ready version

that would be really harder because of the risk of loosing track of the lastest version, files which were change and it would be time consuming
